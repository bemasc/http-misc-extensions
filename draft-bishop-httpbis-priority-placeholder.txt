                    Priority Placeholders in HTTP/2
           draft-bishop-httpbis-priority-placeholders-latest

Abstract

   [RFC7540] defines HTTP/2, including a method for communicating
   priorities.  Some implementations have begun using closed streams as
   placeholders when constructing their priority tree, but this has
   unbounded state commitments and interacts poorly with HTTP/QUIC
   ([I-D.ietf-quic-http]).  This document proposes an extension to the
   HTTP/2 priority scheme for both protocols.

1.  Introduction

   Stream Priority is described in [RFC7540], Section 5.3.  Priority is
   communicated using PRIORITY frames and with reference to other
   streams, with stream 0 being the root of the tree.  Each stream
   depends on one other stream with a particular weight; these weights
   represent relative priorities among the multiple children of a
   stream.

   Unfortunately, the scheme as specified encourages servers to actively
   maintain closed streams in the priority tree, since other streams
   might reference them later.  This produces an unbounded state
   commitment on the part of the server if it is to correctly reflect
   any possible reference the client might make.  While priorities are
   only advisory and the server is free to discard as much state as it
   needs to, references to streams which are no longer in the server's
   state are treated as references to the root of the tree.  This can
   result in wildly different conceptions of the priority tree between
   client and server, a situation which all parties would prefer to
   avoid.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting; when they are capitalized, they have
   the special meaning defined in [RFC2119].

2.  The Priority Placeholder Extension

   This extension consists of an additional setting Section 2.1, new
   flags on the PRIORITY frame Section 2.2, and modified state
   management logic on the server Section 2.3.
